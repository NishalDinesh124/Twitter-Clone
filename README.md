# Twitter Clone

This project is a simplified, personal take on the popular social media platform, Twitter (now X). It's built to explore ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB.

**Key Features (or Planned Features):**

Tweet Creation: Users can compose and post short text-based messages (tweets).
User Profiles: Basic profiles displaying username and a list of their tweets.
Following/Followers (Optional): The ability for users to follow other users and see their tweets in a feed.
Timeline/Feed (Optional): A stream of tweets from users the current user follows (or a global feed of all tweets).
Simple Authentication: Basic user registration and login functionality.
